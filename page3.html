    <h1>Big Bang</h1>
    <h2>History of the big bang theory</h2>
    <p>The history of the Big Bang theory began with the Big Bang's development from observations and theoretical considerations.
         Much of the theoretical work in cosmology now involves extensions and refinements to the basic Big Bang model. The theory itself was originally formalised by Belgian Catholic priest, theoretical physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and professor of physics Georges Lema√Ætre.
         Hubble's Law of the expansion of the universe provided foundational support for the theory.</p>
